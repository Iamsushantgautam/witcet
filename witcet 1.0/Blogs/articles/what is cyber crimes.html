  <h1 style="font-size: 21px;">What is Cyber Crime ? </h1><hr /><br />
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Computers and the internet are arguably the most influential inventions the world has ever 
seen. Computers multiplied the speed of humans to accomplish any task. On the other hand, 
the internet revolutionalised our connectivity to each other. The introduction of computers 
and the internet have transformed our lives so tremendously that we can not imagine our 
daily lives without them now. <br /><br />

Nevertheless, like every coin has two faces, computers and the internet have numerous cons 
which can adversely affect the peace and stability of human lives. Technology is vulnerable to 
misusage. Its advantages and disadvantages largely depend on the person using it. 
Cyberspace (which is the virtual space connecting various computer systems) is susceptible 
to allowing anyone to access the lives of others without their consent or knowledge. To a large 
extent, it conceals the true identity of cybercriminals and prevents them from being punished 
for their crimes.<br /><br />

The impact of cyber crimes is similar to that of conventional ones; however, cyber crimes 
involve a lot of intricacies relating to jurisdiction, the identity of the criminal, etc. Cyberspace 
is a space vulnerable to different interesting varieties of crimes. To know what cyber crimes 
are, let’s dive into this article.</p><br />

<h2>What are cyber crimes</h2>

<p>Cyber crimes are crimes that involve criminal activities done through cyberspace by devices 
connected to the internet. At times, cyber crimes are also called ‘computer crimes’. Most 
cybercriminals commit cyber crimes with mainly three motives- monetary, personal, or 
political.<br /><br />
Though cyber crimes do not physically affect anyone, they tend to seriously harm the 
reputation, finances, and privacy of the targetted persons. Further, another crucial 
characteristic of cyber crimes is the determination of jurisdiction. Since the identity of the 
cybercriminal can be completely erased and mostly stays concealed in cyberspace, it is very 
difficult to identify him/ her. Also, cybercriminals may launch cross-border cyber attacks. For 
instance, a person situated in a country that prohibits pornography may access pornographic 
content that is located on a computer in a country where it is not banned at all. In such cases, 
it is very difficult to determine the liability of the person.
As far as India is concerned, the term cybercrime is not defined under any legal provision. 
However, different types of cyber crimes are illustrated under the Information Technology Act, 
2000 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the IT Act’.) Further, certain provisions of the Indian Penal 
Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the IPC’) are applicable to various cyber crimes also. 
These cyber crimes-related legal provisions under the IT Act and IPC apply to different types 
of cyber crimes, though their specific names are not mentioned therewith.

    <p>Thanks to the expanding cyberspace, various types of cyber crimes are committed worldwide. 

The major objective of committing such crimes is to gather confidential data from people and 

use it for monetary, political, or personal motives.

Generally, almost all cyber crimes can be classified under three heads, depending on the 

groups they are targetted at. The heads are:</p>

 <li> cyber crimes against individuals,</li>

<li> cyber crimes against organizations, and</li>

<li>cyber crimes against society at large.</li>

<center><h2>Cyber crimes against individuals</h2></center>

<p>Generally, ordinary individuals are the most vulnerable targets of cybercriminals. This is due 

to various reasons like lack of information, guidance, and cyber-security. As per a 

recent report published by Norton, 44% of individuals consider themselves as ‘worthwhile 

targets’ for hackers.</p>

<p> The following are some of the main cyber crimes committed targeting individuals. </p>
<h2> Cyberbullying</h2>
   
    

<p>
    The term cyberbullying is not defined under any Indian law. However, in general parlance, 
cyberbullying refers to bullying someone by threatening, harassing or embarrassing the victim 
using technology digital device. Generally, cyberbullying includes the following activities on 
the internet:<br /><br />

</p><li>Humiliating/embarrassing content posted online about the victim of online bullying,</li>
<li> Hacking social media accounts</li>
<li>Posting vulgar messages on social media</li>
<li>Threatening the victim to commit any violent activity</li>
<li>Child pornography or threatening someone with child pornography</li>
<br />
<p>In India, a whopping amount of almost 85% of children experiences cyberbullying. There are 
no specific provisions that deal with cyberbullying. Section 67 of the IT Act is the closest legal 
provision relating to cyberbullying. It penalises anyone who transmits obscene materials in 
electronic form. The punishment for such transmission is imprisonment for a term which may 
extend to five years and a fine which may extend to ten lakh rupees.<br /><br />
Also, Section 66E of the IT Act provides the punishment for violating any person’s privacy 

through the internet. Under this section, any person who intentionally violates anyone’s 

privacy by transmitting, capturing or publishing private pictures of others shall be punished 

with imprisonment up to three years imprisonment or a fine of up to three lakhs.

Further, Section 507 of IPC provides that any person who threatens anyone through 

anonymous communication shall be punished with imprisonment for up to two years.

One of the prime cases in which cyberbullying was discussed was Shreya Singhal v. Union of 

India (2015). In this case, the Hon’ble Supreme Court struck down Section 66A of the IT Act. 

The said Section dealt with the transmission of objectionable messages via a computer 

resource. The court held that the said Section was a violation of Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian 

Constitution, which deals with citizens’ right to freedom of speech and expression. The court

further held that other legal provisions like Sections 66B and 67C of the IT Act and several 

Sections of the IPC were sufficient enough to deal with cyberbullying.

Cyberstalking

Browsing anyone’s internet history or online activity, and sending obscene content online with 

the help of any social media, software, application, etc. to know about that particular person 

is called cyberstalking. Cyberstalkers take advantage of the inconspicuousness provided by 

the internet. They are generally not detectable by the victim, as it is very easy for 

cyberstalkers to open spam accounts just to stalk any person; once the stalker deletes the 

account, his/ her identity completely vanishes.

In India, in the year 2020, the state of Uttar Pradesh witnessed the highest number of 

cyberstalking incidents against women and children, with around 11 thousand registered 

cases. 

Section 67 of the IT Act punishes cyber stalkers who send, cause to send, or publish obscene 

posts or content on electronic media with imprisonment of up to three years and a fine.

Section 354D of IPC deals with stalking. But it is relevant to cyberstalking as well. Under the 

Section, any cyber stalker is punishable with imprisonment up to three years and a fine.

<h2>Cyber defamation</h2>
<p>
    Cyber defamation means injuring the other person’s reputation via the internet through social 
media, Emails etc. There are two types of Cyber defamation: libel and slander.</p>
<li><b> Libel: </b>It refers to any defamatory statement which is in written form. For instance, 
writing defamatory comments on posts, forwarding defamatory messages on social 
media groups, etc. are a part of cyber defamation in the form of libel.</li>
<li><b>Slander: </b>It refers to any defamatory statement published in oral form. For instance, 
uploading videos defaming someone on YouTube is a part of cyber defamation in the 
form of slander.</li> 
<p>Punishment for Cyber defamation is provided under Section 67 of the IT Act; whoever 
publishes or transmits a defamatory statement about a person shall be punished with 2 years 
imprisonment and a fine up to ₹25000.
</p><br />
<h2>Phishing</h2>
<p>Phishing refers to the fraudulent practice of sending emails under the pretext of reputable 
companies to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords, credit card 
numbers, etc., online. Phishing refers to the impersonation of a legitimate person and 
fraudulently stealing someone’s data. Through phishing attacks, cybercriminals not only 
exploit innocent individuals but also spoil the reputation of well-known companies.
Section 66C of the IT Act penalises any offender committing phishing-related activities. It 
provides that anyone who fraudulently uses an electronic signature, password or any other 
unique identification feature of any other person is punishable with imprisonment of up to 
three years and a fine of up to rupees one lakh.<br />

</p><h2>Cyber fraud</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, cyber fraud refers to any act of fraud committed with the use of a 
computer. Any person who dishonestly uses the internet to illegal deceive people and gets 
personal data, communication, etc. with a motive to make money is called a cyber fraud. 
Examples of cyber fraud include sending emails containing fake invoices, sending fake emails 
from email addresses similar to the official ones, etc.<br />
There is no specification for cyber fraud. But Section 420 of IPC which deals with cheating 
applies to cyber fraud also. Punishment for cyber fraud under Section 420 of IPC is 
imprisonment of up to seven years with a fine.</p><br />

<h2> Cyber theft</h2>

<p>Cyber theft is a type of cybercrime which involves the unauthorized access of personal or 
other information of people by using the internet. The main motive of the cyber criminals who 
commit cyber theft is to gather confidential data like passwords, images, phone numbers, etc. 
and use it as leverage to demand a lumpsum amount of money. The unauthorized 
transmission of copyrighted materials, trademarks, etc. over the internet is also a part of 
cyber theft. Cyber thefts are committed through various means, like hacking, email/ SMS 
spoofing, etc.
    </p>
    
    <p>Yahoo!, Inc. v. Akash Arora (1999), which was one of the initial cases related to cyber theft 
in India. In this case, the defendant was accused of using the trademark or domain name
‘yahooindia.com,’. The Court ordered a permanent injunction under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 CPC 
in this case.    
    </p>
    
   <p>Under the IT Act, data theft is defined under Section 43(b) as downloading, copying, or 
extracting any data, computer database or information from such computer, system, or 
network without the permission of its owner. Punishment for cyber theft (specifically, identity 
theft) is provided under Section 66C of the IT Act. The punishment for the same is 
imprisonment of up to three years and/or up to Rs 2 lakh fine.
       
   </p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Spyware
</b></h2><p>Spyware is a type of malware or malicious software, when it is installed it starts accessing and computing the other person’s device without the end user’s knowledge. The primary goal of this software is to steal credit card numbers, passwords, One-Time Passwords (OTPs), etc. Punishment for spyware is provided under Section 43 of the IT Act. It states that if any person damages the computer, system, etc. of any other person without his/ her permission, he/ she shall be liable to pay damages by way of compensation to the person so affected.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Cyber crimes against organizations
</h2><p>The cyber crimes mainly targeting individuals may help cybercriminals get only a meagre amount of ransom, depending on the financial status of the targeted individuals. On the other hand, cyber-attacking large companies or organisations can help them get their hands on extremely confidential data of both private and public institutions or entities. Cyber attacks on organizations are generally launched on a large scale to get a lump sum amount of ransom. Since such attacks drastically damage the companies’ daily operations, most companies try to resolve them as fast as possible. The following are the kinds of cyber crimes launched targeting organizations.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Attacks by virus
</h2><p>A computer virus is a kind of malware which connects itself to another computer program and can replicate and expand when any person attempts to run it on their computer system. For Example, the opening of unknown attachments received from malicious emails may lead to the automatic installation of the virus on the system in which it is opened. These viruses are extremely dangerous, as they can steal or destroy computer data, crash computer systems, etc. The attackers program such malicious viruses to get hold of organisations’ official or confidential data. The illegally retrieved data is then used as leverage to extort ransom from the organisations.</p><br /><p>There are no specific provisions as to virus attacks in India. Nevertheless, Section 383 of IPC, which deals with extortion, is applicable to virus attacks. The Section states that whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury to him or anyone else, and dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any property or valuable security, or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security, commits ‘Extortion’. The punishment for extortion under Section 384 of IPC is imprisonment for up to three years, or fine, or both.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Salami attack</h2><p>It is one of the tactics to steal money, which means the hacker steals the money in small amounts. The damage done is so minor that it is unnoticed. Generally, there are two types of Salami attacks- Salami slicing and Penny shaving. In Salami slicing, the attacker uses anonline database to obtain customer information, such as bank/credit card details. Over time,the attacker deducts insignificant amounts from each account. These sums naturally add up to large sums of money taken from the joint accounts invisibly. Any person convicted of a Salami attack shall be punished under <u>Section 66 IT Act</u> with imprisonment up to three years or a fine up to 5 lakhs or maybe both</p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Web Jacking</h2><p style="text-align: left;"> 
    
Web Jacking refers to the illegal redirection of a user’s browser from a trusted domain’s page 
to a fake domain without the user’s consent. By using the method of Web Jacking, people 
visiting any well-known or reliable website can be easily redirected to bogus websites, which 
in turn lead to the installation of malware, leak of personal data, etc. Web jackers intend to 
illegally collect confidential information of users by enticing them to click on any link which 
may seem genuine at the first glance.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><br />&nbsp;There are no specific provisions dealing with web jacking under any Indian law. However, it 
can be punished under <u>Section 383</u> of IPC, which primarily deals with extortion. The 
punishment for web jacking under Section 383 of IPC is imprisonment of up to three years or 
with a fine, or both.
</p><p style="text-align: left;"><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">

Denial of Service Attack&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Denial of Service Attack or DoS, is a cyber attack on computer devices or systems, preventing 
the legal users or accessors of the system from accessing them. The attackers generally attack 
systems in such a manner by trafficking the targeted system until it ultimately crashes. DoS 
attacks cost millions of dollars to the corporate world, as it curbs them from using their own 
systems and carrying out their activities. The attack may be also used to incorporate 
ransomware into corporate systems.
Cyber attackers who launch DoS in India are punishable under Section 66F of the IT Act, which 
deals with cyber terrorism. As per the said Section, any person who disrupts the authorised 
access to a computer resource or gets access to a computer resource through unauthorised 
means or causes damage to a computer network is liable for imprisonment which may extend 
for life.&nbsp;<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;"><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Data diddling</h2>&nbsp;Data diddling is a cyber crime which involves the unauthorized alteration of data entries on a 
computer. It may be done either before or during the entry of such data. It is generally 
committed by way of computer virus attacks. At times, to conceal the alteration, the altered 
data is changed to its original data after retrieving the required information. Usually, the 
strategic or statistical data of large companies.
In India, data diddling is an offence under Section 65 of the IT Act. The said Section provides 
that knowingly or intentionally concealing, destroying, altering or causing another to conceal, 
destroy, or alter any computer source code used for a computer, computer programme, 
computer system or computer network is punishable with imprisonment of up to three years 
or with fine of up to two lakhs.<p></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Cyber crimes against society at large</h2><p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Apart from the cyber crimes committed targeting individuals in society, various other cyber 
attacks are launched against the community at large. Such cyber crimes may be aimed either 
against any particular section of society or the entire country. The following are a few types 
of cyber crimes against the community at large.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Cyber pornography&nbsp;</h2><div>As per Merriam-Webster Dictionary, pornography is the depiction of erotic behaviour (as in 
pictures or writing) intended to cause sexual excitement. Accordingly, cyber pornography 
refers to using the internet to display, distribute, import, or publish pornography or obscene 
materials.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;Under the IT Act, provisions as to cyber pornography are given under Section 67 of the IT 
Act. It states that the following activities are punishable with imprisonment of up to 3 years 
and a fine of up to 5 lakhs:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>&nbsp; Uploading pornographic content on any website, social media, etc. where third 
parties may access it.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Transmitting obscene photos to anyone through email, messaging, social media, etc.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Cyber terrorism</h2><div>&nbsp;Cyber terrorism means using cyberspace to hurt the general public and damage the integrity 
and sovereignty of any country. The IT Act defines cyber terrorism under Section 66F as any 
acts done by a person with the intent to create a threat to the unity, integrity, sovereignty 
and security of the nation or create terror in minds of people or section of people by way of 
disrupting the authorised access to a computer resource or getting access to a computer 
resource through unauthorised means or causing damage to a computer network.
Cyber terrorism is generally carried out in the following ways:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>1. Hacking government-owned systems of the target country and getting confidential 
information.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;2. Destructing and destroying government databases and backups by incorporating 
viruses or malware into the systems.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;3. Disrupting government networks of the target nation.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;4. Distracting the government authorities and preventing them from focusing on 
matters of priority.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;The punishment for cyber terrorism as provided under Section 66F of the IT Act is 
imprisonment of up to 3 years and/or up to Rs 2 lakh fine.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Cyber Espionage</h2><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, espionage is “the practice of spying or using spies 
to obtain information about the plans and activities especially of a foreign government or a 
competing company.” Similarly, cyber espionage refers to the unauthorized accessing of 
sensitive data or intellectual property for economic, or political reasons. It is also called ‘cyber 
spying’.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In most cases of cyber espionage, spies in the form of hackers are deliberately recruited to 
launch cyber attacks on the government systems of enemy nations to stealthily collect 
confidential information. The cross-border exposure of sensitive data related to any country 
can continue as long as it stays undetected. The information gathered through cyber 
espionage is then used by the gathering country to either combat or launch military or political 
attacks on the enemy country.
Generally, the following data are gathered through cyber espionage:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>• Military data&nbsp;</div><div>• Academic research-related data</div><div>• Intellectual property&nbsp;</div><div>• Politically strategic data, etc.</div><div><br /></div>

Though cyber espionage has serious consequences, unfortunately, there are no specific 
provisions related to it under any Indian law. However, cyber spies may be punished 
under Section 120A of IPC, which deals with criminal conspiracy. It provides that when two or 
more persons agree to do, or cause to be done, –&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>• an illegal act, or&nbsp;</div><div>• an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agreement is designated a 
criminal conspiracy.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The punishment of criminal conspiracy is provided under Section 120B of IPC as a death 
sentence, imprisonment for life, and rigorous imprisonment for at least 2 years.
Further, any Indian who abets cyber espionage against India can be also punished 
under Section 121 of IPC, which deals with waging, attempting, or abetting waging war 
against the Government of India. The punishment prescribed for the same is the death 
sentence, imprisonment for life, and a fine.</div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Conclusion&nbsp;</h2><div><br /></div><div>Cybercrime is a massive threat to any country. It has the threatening potential to trigger 
national unrest, financial crisis, the shutdown of services, etc. In 2020 alone India witnessed 
a whopping number of fifty thousand registered cyber crimes. These cyber crimes adversely 
affect the lives of thousands of innocent individuals, companies, and governments. Also, 
several cyber attack cases go unreported due to a lack of awareness or infrastructure.
Cyberspace is a wonderful space to stay connected, no matter how physically far people are. 
However, it is also a grey area when it comes to the enforcement of cyber laws. There are 
multiple challenges involved in legislating and implementing cyber laws because of the 
dynamic nature of cyberspace. Nevertheless, the government must strive to spread cyber-
awareness to people to help them steer away from cyber-attacks and stay cyber-safe.</div>
